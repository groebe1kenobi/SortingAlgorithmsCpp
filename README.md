# SortingAlgorithmsCpp
Program designed to test run time of various sorting algorithms:

1.	Insertionsort
2.	Quicksort (recursive version) use the right-most element as pivot
3.	Quicksort (recursive version), use the right-most element as pivot and switch to insertion sort when size of array is         less than certain predetermined integer -- the cutoff size 
4.	Quicksort2 (recursive version), use the median of three as the pivot element.
5.	Mergesort 
6.	Heapsort

The user is prompted to choose a length for the array.
Then, user is prompted to select a type of simulated input data:
1. Sorted, Descending
2. Sorted, Ascending
3. Data all of the same value
4. Random Order

Run Time displayed at bottom.
